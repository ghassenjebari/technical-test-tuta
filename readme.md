Tuta Technical Test

I used Vite to initialize this project with vanilla TypeScript.

How to Run

Clone the repository from GitHub, run npm install, then npm run dev.

Design Choices

I used the same colors from the Tuta website. To mock the API I used some files from the official website.

Code & Comments

Normally I donâ€™t add too many comments because it can add noise to the code. Since this is a technical test, I added more comments in two files to explain exactly what I did. Usually I only put comments when the code itself is not understandable.

Git Workflow

I made an initial commit, created two branches: one for adding the API mock with throttling, and another for setting the design of the project. Then I merged them into main. I also added small commits to show order in my work.
